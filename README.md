## 🧠 About the Game

In **Talking Tunes**, each keyboard key is randomly mapped to a unique sound. A sequence of sounds is displayed on the screen, and your goal is to play the correct sequence by hitting the corresponding keys.

- ✅ Press the correct keys in the exact sequence → **You win!**
- ❌ Press a wrong key → The game **restarts from the beginning**

It's a perfect blend of memory, rhythm, and quick reflexes!
